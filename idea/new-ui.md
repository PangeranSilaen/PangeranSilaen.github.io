# PERSONAL BRANDING WEBSITE — UI & CONTENT BRIEF
Author: Pangeran Borneo Silaen  
Purpose: Personal branding (NOT for internship, NOT resume-style)  
Tone: Calm, confident, editorial, modern, human  
Constraint: NON-SYMMETRICAL LAYOUT — avoid rigid grids and centered perfection

---

## 1. OVERALL DESIGN DIRECTION

Design a fresh, editorial-style personal website.
The site should feel:
- Thoughtful, not loud
- Confident, not promotional
- Modern, not futuristic
- Human, not template-based

Avoid symmetry.
Avoid centered layouts.
Avoid overly clean “AI-generated” aesthetics.

The layout should feel intentionally unbalanced, similar to modern editorial brand websites.

---

## 2. VISUAL LANGUAGE

### Color
- Base background: warm off-white or very light neutral
- Primary text: deep charcoal or very dark green/blue
- Accent color: ONE muted accent only (sage, muted teal, muted purple, or deep green)

No neon.
No excessive gradients.
Accent color only for emphasis, CTA, or subtle dividers.

---

### Typography
- Headlines: modern serif or humanist serif
- Body text: clean sans-serif
- Strong hierarchy:
  - Headlines are large and expressive
  - Body text is short and readable
  - Plenty of negative space

---

## 3. LAYOUT PRINCIPLES (VERY IMPORTANT)

- Do NOT center everything
- Use offset sections
- Unequal margins are encouraged
- Text and images should not align perfectly
- Some sections may feel intentionally asymmetrical

The layout should feel “designed by taste”, not “generated by grid”.

---

## 4. HERO SECTION

Purpose: Make a strong editorial statement, not an introduction.

### Headline (example direction)
“I build digital products with a modern, thoughtful, and AI-assisted approach.”

### Supporting text
Web and mobile developer focused on React, Laravel, and clean UI.
I use AI as a productivity partner — from ideation to iteration — while keeping full control over logic and design decisions.

### Visual
- Portrait photo (NOT circular)
- Slightly offset from text
- Soft edges or organic crop
- Image should not be centered

### CTA
- View Work
- About Me

CTA buttons should be subtle, not aggressive.

---

## 5. ABOUT SECTION — MINDSET OVER BIO

This section explains how I think and work, not a CV.

### Narrative focus
- How I approach building applications
- How I learn and explore
- How I integrate AI into my workflow

### Key idea
I use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement for thinking.
AI helps me explore ideas faster, debug efficiently, and iterate designs — while I remain responsible for structure and decisions.

Layout should feel like a magazine column, not a profile card.

---

## 6. AI-ASSISTED WORKFLOW (DEDICATED SECTION)

Title direction:
“Building with AI as a collaborator”

Content points:
- Idea exploration and problem framing
- Rapid prototyping and boilerplate generation
- Debugging and refactoring assistance
- Faster iteration without sacrificing clarity

This section should feel modern, relevant, and grounded.
No hype language.
No technical tutorials.

---

## 7. TECH STACK (MINIMAL, TEXT-BASED)

Avoid icon grids.
Avoid skill bars.

Simple categorized text:

Frontend:
React, Vue, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

Backend:
Laravel, Node.js, Express

Mobile:
React Native

Tools:
Git, GitHub, Figma

The presentation should feel confident and understated.

---

Each project should feel like a short editorial feature.
