Adjust the color system: avoid pure white backgrounds. Use a warm off-white base and tinted section surfaces to create depth.

Use this palette:
BG #F3F1EC
Surface #ECE8E1
Text #141414
Muted #4A4A4A
Primary #0F3D3E
Accent #6B8F71
Border #D8D2C8

Rules:
- Alternate sections between BG and Surface (banding) to prevent flatness.
- Use Border color for dividers and subtle outlines.
- Make primary CTA button filled with Primary (#0F3D3E) and white text.
- Links use Primary text color with subtle hover underline or background tint.
- Project tags use tinted pills (Surface + border), not plain white chips.
- Keep the editorial feel; do not introduce neon colors, heavy gradients, or dark theme.
