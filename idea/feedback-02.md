Refine the mobile experience:
- Do not simply stack desktop sections vertically.
- Avoid centered layouts on mobile; use left-aligned text and offset images.
- Introduce visual anchors to slow scrolling.
- Break long text into shorter blocks with emphasized statements.
- Allow certain elements to slightly break the grid or overflow horizontally.
- Create rhythm and hierarchy between sections so mobile feels designed, not compressed.
