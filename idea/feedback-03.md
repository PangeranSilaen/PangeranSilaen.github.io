Refine the MOBILE HERO and overall mobile layout with an editorial mindset.

Current issue:
The mobile layout feels too safe and vertically stacked. The portrait image placement looks like a profile photo rather than a designed element.

GOALS:
- Make the hero feel designed specifically for mobile, not a compressed desktop version.
- Avoid centered compositions and symmetrical stacking.
- Create visual rhythm and intentional imbalance.

MOBILE HERO INSTRUCTIONS:
- The headline must be the primary focal point, not the image.
- Place the portrait image AFTER the main headline, not above it.
- Do NOT center the image.
- Offset the image horizontally (shift it 60–70% to the right or left).
- Crop the image more aggressively so it feels editorial (it should not look like a LinkedIn or ID photo).
- Allow the image to feel like an interrupting visual element rather than a standalone block.

TEXT & TYPOGRAPHY (MOBILE):
- Left-align all hero text.
- Allow the headline to wrap naturally with fewer words per line for editorial impact.
- Reduce excessive vertical spacing between hero elements.
- Keep the copy readable but avoid long uninterrupted paragraphs on mobile.

CTA (MOBILE):
- Primary CTA should be visually stronger (filled button).
- Secondary CTA should remain text-based.
- Reduce vertical distance between copy and CTA to maintain momentum.

SECTION FLOW (MOBILE):
- Do not stack all sections uniformly.
- Introduce variation in spacing and alignment between sections.
- Allow certain elements (images, cards, workflow box) to slightly break the content width or overflow horizontally.
- Create clear visual beats between sections to slow scrolling.

WORKFLOW SECTION:
- The “Building with AI as a collaborator” box should feel like a featured insert.
- Offset it slightly from the main content column on mobile.
- Avoid perfectly centered cards.

PROJECT LIST (MOBILE):
- Avoid identical visual weight for all projects.
- Make the first project more prominent.
- Subsequent projects can be more compact to create hierarchy.

COLOR & SURFACE (MOBILE):
- Avoid pure white backgrounds.
- Use warm off-white as the base.
- Alternate between base background and subtle tinted surfaces to prevent flatness.
- Maintain calm, editorial contrast — no neon, no dark mode.

FINAL CONSTRAINTS:
- No emojis.
- No symmetry.
- No centered hero composition.
- No template-like vertical stacking.
- The result should feel intentional, human-designed, and editorial.
